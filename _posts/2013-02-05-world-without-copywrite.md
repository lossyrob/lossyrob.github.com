### What would a world without copywrite look like?

Open Access. Open Data. Libre Knowledge. Open Source.

There is a shift in the way society understands data. The shift is occurring without direct proponents, although they exist. The shift is happening because of an innate human desire to share, to communicate. It is also happening now, at a wildfire rate, because for the first time in history the technology available to share information is severely outpacing society's ability to take advantage of it. The foundation that institutions controlling access to communication is being subverted by technological advances. Technological advances in digital communication happens in a manner such that no institution can keep up with how new ways of communicating will affect their control. Vast portions of the public can begin to utilize new ways of communicating before those institutions can control the way those individuals can access data.

It is time to embrace this. It is time to understand as a people that those institutions which try to hold onto control of information are working against the natural progression of our world community.

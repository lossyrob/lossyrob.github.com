### What would a world without copywrite look like?

Open Access. Open Data. Libre Knowledge. Open Source.

There is a shift in the way society understands data. The shift is occurring without direct proponents, although they exist. The shift is happening because of an innate human desire to share, to communicate. It is also happening now, at a wildfire rate, because for the first time in history the technology available to share information is severely outpacing society's ability to take advantage of it. The core foundation of institutions controlling access to communication is being subverted by technological advances. Technological advances in digital communication happens in a manner such that no institution can keep up with how new ways of communicating will affect their control. Vast portions of the public can begin to utilize new ways of communicating before those institutions can control the way those individuals can access data.

It is time to embrace this. It is time to understand as a people that those institutions which try to hold onto control of information are working against the natural progression of our world community.

I propound the assertion that there is that in the future all data will be free. From the invention of the printing press to the current state of data sharing, we as a society have been marching towards an eventuality  that no person or institution can prevent: all data will be accessible by anyone. Every human experience that is captured and persisted will be available for study, analysis, and consumption by every human.

The platonic ideal, the limit of the path that we as a species are travelling along, is instant communication of any data to any person. It may be the case that the technology of the future may never reach that ideal point exactly; but reaching the limiting point will be prohibited not by choice of institution but by limitations in technology to capture, analyze, and distribute data.

If this assertion is accepted as true, then it follows that any form of prohibition on the use of data is blocking the natural course of human progression.
